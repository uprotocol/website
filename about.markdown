After spending too much time on a file-sharing app, the idea of 
*opening the capabilities of the app to the world so that other 
apps can use the communication channel* was born.

Simply put, the app was going to use a standard protocol that 
aims to be as generic and user-friendly as possible. There 
were a lot of solutions (even the open ones) that didn't document
how they worked, so the new protocol was going to fix that. And 
that protocol is **uprotocol**.

uprotocol uses CoolSocket, a TCP messaging library, under the hood 
and enforces encryption by default.
